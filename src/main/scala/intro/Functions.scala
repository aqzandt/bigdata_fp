  /**
   * Scala supports both `val`/`var` variables (There is actually one more type,
   * but that is outside of the scope of this course).
   * The difference is that once you assign a value to a `val` it cannot be
   * reassigned. If you would use `var` you can reassign its value though.
   * Functional Programming purists will consider var as blasphemy, but Scala
   * is a bit more pragmatic supporting both imperative programming with vars
   * and mutability as well as the functional style with `val`s and
   * immutability. Within this lab assignment you are *NOT* allowed to use
   * `var` to help speed up the functional programming learning process.
   *
   * Instead of the above method body between braces you could also write more
   * minimalistic:
   *
   * def simpleMath(i: Int) = i * 5 + 2
   *
   * The above expression can also be defined as an anonymous function and
   * assigned to a variable, i.e. the anonymous function (or lambda or lambda
   * expression as it is also called) can be written as follows:
   *
   * (i: Int) => i * 5 + 2
   *
   * This can be assigned to a variable called simpleMath by:
   *
   * val simpleMath = (i: Int) => i * 5 + 2
   *
   * So from this example you see that defining an anonymous function is done
   * by first supplying the input parameters between () separated by commas,
   * followed by a '=>', ending with the method body.
   *
   * You can apply such a function for example to a list by supplying it to
   * methods that take a function as input parameter. Be careful of the
   * correct function signature or else your compiler/interpreter/IDE
   * will complain.
   *
   * Example usage:
   * List(22,34,48).map(increaseGrade) // results in List(112, 172, 242)
   *
   * This example takes our lambda and applies it to each element of the list
   * It works because:
   * 		1. List.map takes a function as input parameter
   *       2. final def map[B](f: (A) => B): List[B] is the function signature
   *       of map. It takes a function (A) => B, a function which takes a
   *       type A element, does something to it, and returns a type B.
   *       Our anonymous function is of type Int => Int, so this works.

  /** Q1 (1p)
   * You've seen an example of anonymous functions in Scala.

   * anonymous functions with methods bodies and provide the correct
   * function signature for `myFirstHOF`/`mySecondHOF` in the method body of
   * `hofs` such that running `hofs()` results in the Lists given in
   * Note1

  // TODO: replace the ??? with lambda expressions (anonymous functions)
  val isEven = (i: Int) => ??? // tells whether given Int is even or not
  val isOdd = (i: Int) => ??? // same but this time if it's odd

  def hofs(): List[List[Int]] = ???
  // TODO change this method below:
  //
  //	{
  //		// TODO:
  //		// - Look up the List functions used in the Scala API
  //		// - change the parameter type of f in both HOFS below
  //		//   from ...... to the correct type
  // - then uncomment this block and remove the `???`
  //		def myFirstHOF(xs: List[Int], f: ...... ) : List[Int] =
  //			xs.filter(f)
  //		def mySecondHOF(xs: List[Int], f: ...... ) : List[Int] =

  /* Note 1
   * running println(hofs()) results in
   * List(List(2,4), List(1,3), List(20,22,24,26,28,30))
   *
   * It is also good for you to see that you can define methods within methods
   * (if you ever need helper methods but do not want the outer world to see,
   * use this technique, i.e. it does more or less the same as defining a
   * private helper function and calling that from with the method body)
   */

  /* Note 2:
   * As you can see from inspecting the function signature of `hofs`
   * it takes no input parameters and returns a List of List[Int]
   *
   * You don't need to specify the return type, except for recursive
   * functions; Scala will infer most return types for you. It is however good
   * practice to specify the return type when defining the function signature.
   * If you read another person's code without reading the whole method body,
   * having the complete function signature including return type is a hint to
   * its inner workings. Also, when debugging, it can really help you to view
   * the function as a blackbox with input/output types, so supplying the
   * return type has good benefits.
